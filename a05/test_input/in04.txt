chapter 1 mr sherlock holmes



mr sherlock holmes who was usually very late in the mornings save
upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night was seated
at the breakfast table i stood upon the hearth  rug and picked up the
stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before it was a
fine thick piece of wood bulbous  headed of the sort which is known as
a penang lawyer just under the head was a broad silver band nearly
an inch across to james mortimer mrcs from his friends of the
cch was engraved upon it with the date 1884 it was just such a
stick as the old  fashioned family practitioner used to carry dignified
solid and reassuring

well watson what do you make of it

holmes was sitting with his back to me and i had given him no sign of
my occupation

how did you know what i was doing i believe you have eyes in the back
of your head

i have at least a well  polished silver  plated coffee  pot in front of
me said he but tell me watson what do you make of our visitors
stick since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no
notion of his errand this accidental souvenir becomes of importance
let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it

i think said i following as far as i could the methods of my
companion that dr mortimer is a successful elderly medical man
well  esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their
appreciation

good said holmes excellent
